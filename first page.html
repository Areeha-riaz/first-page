<h1>What is Motivation?</h1>
<p>The term "motivation" describes why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions. Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors.

    For instance, motivation is what helps you lose extra weight, or pushes you to get that promotion at work. In short, motivation causes you to act in a way that gets you closer to your goals. Motivation includes the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive forces that activate human behavior.</p>

        <h2>Why Motivation Is Important</h2>
        <p>Motivation serves as a guiding force for all human behavior. So, understanding how motivation works and the factors that may impact it can be important for several reasons.

            Understanding motivation can:
            Drive you to take action
            Encourage you to engage in health-oriented behaviors
            Help you avoid unhealthy or maladaptive behaviors, such as risk-taking and addiction
            Help you feel more in control of your life
            Improve your overall well-being
        
        </p>
        <p class="para"> When we are faced with difficult times as we are now with the effects of a worldwide pandemic, it is easy to get
        discouraged and lose hope. Hope is a vital component of human existence, and it is needed to find happiness and peace
        during times that might otherwise lead us to be discouraged. As Andrew Carnegie so clearly pointed out, setting a goal
        can keep your thoughts focused, direct your energy, and inspire the hope that is needed to move through and beyond a
        moment of despair.</p>
